Potential Challenges in Deployment:

Dependency Management: Ensuring that all necessary libraries and services (like databases) are properly configured and available inside the container.
Environment Configuration: Managing different environment variables (development, production) and secrets securely in Docker.
Scaling and Load Balancing: Running multiple instances of the container and managing network traffic, load balancing, and autoscaling.
Persistent Storage: Managing data persistence, especially for databases, if needed outside the containerized environment.
Network and Security: Setting up secure communication, firewall settings, and properly configuring network access between containers.
Compatibility Issues: Ensuring that the Docker image runs consistently across different environments or cloud platforms.
